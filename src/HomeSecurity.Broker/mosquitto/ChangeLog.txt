1.0.3 - 20120927
================

Broker:
- Fix loading of psk files.
- Don't return an error when reloading config if an ACL file isn't defined.
  This was preventing psk files being reloaded.
- Clarify meaning of $SYS/broker/clients/total in mosquitto(8) man page.
- Clarify meaning of $SYS/broker/messages/stored in mosquitto(8) man page.
- Fix non-retained message delivery when subscribing to #.

  installations.

1.0.2 - 20120919
================

Broker:
- If the broker was configured for persistence, a durable client had a
  subscription to topics in $SYS/# and had messages in its queue when the
  broker restarted, then the persistent database would have messages missing
  and so the broker would not restart properly. This has been fixed.

Library:
- Fix threading problem on some systems.

Tests:
- Close socket after 08-ssl-connect-no-auth-wrong-ca.py test to prevent
  subsequent tests having problems.

  devices.
- Passwords are now salted+hashed if compiled with WITH_TLS (recommended).
- Add mosquitto_passwd for handling password files.
- Add $SYS/broker/publish/messages/{sent|received} to show the number of
  PUBLISH messages sent/received.
- Add $SYS/broker/publish/bytes/{sent|received} to show the number of
  PUBLISH bytes sent/received.
- Add reload parameter for security init/cleanup functions.
- Add option for expiring disconnected persistent clients.
- Add option for queueing of QoS 0 messages when persistent clients are
  disconnected.

  potentially causing problems with ACLs. This has been fixed.
- Significant improvement to memory handling on Windows.
- Bridges with outgoing topics will now set the retain flag correctly so that
  messages will be retained on the remote broker.
- Incoming bridge connections are now detected by checking if bit 8 of the
  protocol version number is set. This requires support from the remote broker.
- Add support for notification_topic option.
- Add $SYS/broker/subscriptions/count and $SYS/broker/retained messages/count.
- Add restart_timeout to control the amount of time an automatic bridge will

- Clients that had disconnected were not always being detected immediately on
  Linux. This has been fixed.
- Don't save $SYS messages to the on-disk persistent db. All $SYS messages
  should be reconstructed on a restart. This means bridge connection
  notifications will now be correct on a restart.
- Fix reloading of bridge clients from the persistent db. This means that
  outgoing bridged topics should always work.
- Local bridges are now no longer restricted by local ACLs.

- Add TLS-PSK support, providing a simpler encryption method for constrained
  devices.
- Add javascript/websockets client library.
- Add "struct mosquitto *mosq" parameter for all callbacks in the client
  library. This is a binary incompatible change so the soversion of the
  libraries has been incremented. The new parameter should make it easier to

  was unexpected or the result of calling mosquitto_disconnect().
- Add mosquitto_strerror() for obtaining a string description of error numbers.
- Add mosquitto_connack_string() for obtaining a string description of MQTT
  connection results.
- Add mosquitto_will_clear() and change mosquitto_will_set() to only set the

  subscription.
- Replaced mosquitto_log_init() with mosquitto_log_callback_set() to allow
  clients to decide what to do with log messages.
- Client will now disconnect itself from the broker if it doesn't receive a
  PINGRESP in the keepalive period after sending a PINGREQ.
- Client will now send a PINGREQ if it has not received a message from the
  broker in keepalive seconds.
- mosquitto_new() will now generate a random client id if the id parameter is
  NULL.
- Added max_packets to mosquitto_loop(), mosquitto_loop_read() and
  mosquitto_loop_write() to control the maximum number of packets that are
  handled per call.
- Payload parameters are now void * instead of uint8_t *.
- The clean_session parameter has been moved from mosquitto_connect() to
  mosquitto_new() because it is a client parameter rather than a connection
  parameter.
- Functions now use int instead of uint*_t where possible.
- mosquitto_new() now sets errno to indicate failure type.
- Return MOSQ_ERR_INVAL on zero length topic.
- Fix automatic client id generation on Windows.

0.9 - 20101114
==============

- Client and message data is now stored in memory with custom routines rather

  sqlite3-pcre. It also means that the persistent database format has had to
  be reimplemented in a custom format. Optional support for importing old
  sqlite databases is provided.
- Added IPv6 support for mosquitto and the clients.
- Provide username and password support for the clients and client libraries.
  This is part of the new MQTT v3.1 spec.
- The broker supports the username and password connection flags, but will not
  do anything with the username and password.
- Python callback functions now optionally take an extra argument which will
  return the user object passed to the Mosquitto() constructor, or the calling
  python object itself if nothing was given to Mosquitto().
- Remove the mosquitto command line option "-i interface".
- Remove the mosquitto.conf "interface" variable.
- Add support for the listener config variable (replaces the interface
  variable)

- Change the port config variable behaviour to match that of rsmb (applies to
  the default listener only, can be given just once).
- Fix QoS 2 protocol compliance - stop sending duplicate messages and handle
  timeouts correctly. Fixes bug #598290.

  messages sent in response to a subscribe command (ie. stale data).
- Fix bug in returning correct CONNACK result to on_connect client callback.
- Don't send client will if it is disconnected for exceeding its keepalive
  timer.
- Fix client library unsubscribe function incorrectly sending a SUBSCRIBE

  parameters now apply only to QoS 1 and 2 messages and are used regardless of
  the client connection state.
- mosquitto.conf now installed to /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf instead of
  /etc/mosquitto.conf. The /etc/mosquitto/ directory will be used for password
  and access control files in the future.
- Give the compile time option of using 32-bit integers for the database IDs
  instead of 64-bit integers. This is useful where htobe64()/be64toh() are not
  available or for embedded systems for example.
- The DUP bit is now set correctly when resending PUBREL messages.
- A port to Windows native has been partially completed. This currently drops a
  number of features, including the ability to change configuration parameters
  and persistent storage.

  a /. For example, /topic/path is different to topic/path. This matches the
  behaviour of rsmb.
- Correctly calculate the will QoS on a new client connection (bug #597451).
- Add "addresses" configuration file variable as an alias of "address", for
  better rsmb compatibility.
- Bridge clean_session setting is now false, to give more sensible behaviour
  and be more compatible with rsmb.

  message store.
- Add support for disabling "clean session" for the sub client.
- Add support for automatic upgrading of the mosquitto DB from v1 to v2.

  wasn't correctly fixed in version 0.5.
- Don't disconnect clients if they send a PUBLISH with zero length payload
  (bug #573610).
- If a retained message is received with a zero length payload, the retained
  message for that topic is deleted.
- Send through zero length messages.
- Produce a warning on unsupported rsmb options instead of quitting.
- Describe clean session flag in the mqtt man page.
- Implement the max_inflight_messages and max_queued_messages features in the
  broker.

  through the main loop once autosave_interval has been reached.
- Report $SYS/broker/uptime in the same format as rsmb.
- Make mandatory options obvious in usage output and man page of mosquitto_pub.
  Fixes bug #529990.

  #530369 and #530099.
  
0.5.1 - 20100227
================

- Must daemonise before pid file is written.

0.5 - 20100227
==============

- No longer store QoS=0 messages for disconnected clients that do not have
  clean start set.
- Rename msg_timeout option to retry_interval for better rsmb compatibility.
- Change persistence behaviour. The database is now stored in memory even if
  persistence is enabled. It is written to disk when mosquitto exits and also at
  periodic intervals as defined by the new autosave_interval option.
- The writing of the persistence database may be forced by sending mosquitto
  the SIGUSR1 signal.
- Clients that do not send CONNECT as their first command are now
  disconnected.
- Boolean configuration values may now be specified with true/false as well as
  1/0.

- Add mosquitto_sub and mosquitto_pub, simple clients for subscribe/publish.
- Add man pages for clients.
- Add general man page on mqtt.
- Root privileges are now dropped only after attempting to write a pid file
  (if configured). This means that the pid file can be written to /var/run/
  directly and should fix bug #523183.

0.4.2 - 20100203
================

- Fix segfault on client connect with invalid protocol name/version.

0.4.1 - 20100112
===============

- Fix regex used for finding retained messages to send on new subscription.

0.4 - 20100105
==============

- Keepalive==0 is now correctly treated as "never disconnect".
- Fixed manpage installation.
- Fixed incorrect $SYS hierarchy locations in documentation and code.
- Debug type log messages are no longer sent to "topics".
- Default logging destination no longer includes "topics" to prevent possible
  error logging to the db before it is initialised.
- Periodic $SYS messages can now be disabled.
- stdout and stderr are flushed when logging to them to give more timely
  updates.
- dup is now set correctly when resending messages.
- Database format bumped due to topic column naming fix.

0.3 - 20091217
==============

- The port option in the configuration file and --port command line argument
  may now be given any number of times to make mosquitto listen on multiple
  sockets.
- Add new config file and command line option "interface" to specify an
  interface to listen on, rather than all interfaces.
- Added host access control through tcp-wrappers support.
- Set SO_REUSEADDR on the listening socket so restart is much quicker.
- Added support for tracking current heap memory usage - this is published on
  the topic "$SYS/broker/heap/current size"
- Added code for logging to stderr, stdout, syslog and topics. 
- Added logging to numerous places - still plenty of scope for more.

0.2 - 20091204
==============

- Replaced the command line option --foreground with --daemon, swapping the
  default behaviour.
- Added the command line option --config-file, to specify a config file to
  load.  If this is not given, no config file is load and the default options
  are used.
- Added the command line option --port for specifying the port to listen on.
  This overrides values in the config file.
- Don't use persistence by default.
- Default behaviour is now more sane when run by a normal user with no command
  line options (combination of above changes).
- Added option user to config file, defaulting to a value of mosquitto. If
  this value isn't blank and mosquitto is started by root, then it will drop
  privileges by changing to the user and its primary group. This replaces the
  current behaviour of refusing to start if run by root.
- Fix non-persistent mode, which would never work in the previous release.
- Added information on default values of msg_timeout and sys_interval to the
  mosquitto.conf man page. (closes bug #492045).

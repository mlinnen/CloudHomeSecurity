<h2>Door Bell</h2>
<p>The door bell device has several functions in the home security system.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Indicates which door bell was rang</li>
</ul>
<p>There can be more than 1 door bell device in the home.  The idea is to place the device in a location where the home owner would be likely to see or hear the bell.
